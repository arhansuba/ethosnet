# EthosNet: Decentralized Ethical AI Infrastructure

EthosNet is a groundbreaking platform that combines decentralized AI infrastructure with ethical governance to address the pressing need for responsible AI development. By leveraging GaiaNet's distributed computing capabilities, EthosNet creates a transparent and accountable environment for AI creation, deployment, and monitoring.

## Features

- **Decentralized Ethics Knowledge Base**: A community-driven repository of ethical guidelines and best practices for AI development.
- **Real-time AI Decision Evaluation**: Evaluate AI decisions against established ethical standards in real-time.
- **Interactive Ethics Scenarios**: Engage the community with challenging ethical scenarios to promote learning and discussion.
- **Reputation System**: Incentivize ethical contributions and maintain quality through a blockchain-based reputation system.
- **Transparent Governance**: Utilize smart contracts for proposal creation, voting, and implementation of ethical standards.
- **Advanced LLM Integration**: Leverage state-of-the-art language models for various tasks, including ethics evaluation and knowledge base management.
- **Efficient Vector Database**: Utilize Qdrant for fast similarity searches and efficient knowledge retrieval.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Record key actions and decisions on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and accountability.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (configurable for other databases)
- **Vector Database**: Qdrant
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Web3.py)
- **AI/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for frontend, if applicable)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/arhansuba/ethosnet.git
   cd ethosnet
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv ethosnet-env
   source ethosnet-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ethosnet-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Fill in the required variables in the `.env` file

5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   python -c "from app.db.base import Base; from app.db.session import engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"
   ```

6. Start the application:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.
